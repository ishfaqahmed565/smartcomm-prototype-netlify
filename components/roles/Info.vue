	<p class="info-text text-gray-600">
		Roles allow you to create and edit access permissions for agents. You can
		create new roles, specify what actions agents with these roles can perform
		within your help desk, and assign the role to agents.
	</p>
	<p class="info-text text-gray-600">
		For example, you can create a role for your Support Co-ordinators, allowing
		them to update fields and assign tickets, and even add notes internally, but
		not reply to customers.
	</p>
	<p class="info-text text-gray-600">
		Once you create and save a new Role you will be able to assign it to agents
		when you create or edit their profile by clicking on the Agents icon under
		the admin tab.
	</p>
	<p class="info-text text-gray-600">
		You can have up to 100 roles in your account.
	</p>
	<h5 class="info-header font-bold">Admin Privileges</h5>
	<p class="info-text text-gray-600">
		You can nominate whether you want an agent to have access to settings under
		the Admin tab. Agents with admin access can be Operation Agents with limited
		access, or Super Admins with the ability to edit all configurations. You can
		have as many Super Admins with the ability to view and modify your billing
		details, or as few as one.
