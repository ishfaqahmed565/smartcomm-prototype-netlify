	<p class="info-text text-gray-600">
		Collaborators are other agents, other team members, or third party contacts
		whose input is needed to resolve a customer ticket.
	</p>
	<p class="info-text text-gray-600">
		Ticket collaborators can get assigned/tagged to tickets, add/edit private
		notes within their scope, update ticket status, modify their time entry,
		view customer information related to the ticket.
	</p>
	<p class="info-text text-gray-600">
		Analytics collaborators can view reports in the Analytics module.
	</p>
	<h5 class="info-header font-bold">Scopes and Roles</h5>
	<p class="info-text text-gray-600">
		You can choose which tickets your agents can see by modifying their Ticket
		Scope. You should also specify what actions an agent is able to perform
		within your helpdesk by choosing a Role.
	</p>
	<p class="info-text text-gray-600">
		Note that you will not be able to either modify your own roles or delete
		yourself as an agent.
	</p>
	<h5 class="info-header font-bold">Groups</h5>
	<p class="info-text text-gray-600">
		You can organize agents into specific groups such as Sales and Product
		Management. Segmenting agents into divisions lets you easily assign tickets,
		create specific canned responses, manage workflows and generate group-level
		reports. Note that an agent can be a member of multiple groups.
